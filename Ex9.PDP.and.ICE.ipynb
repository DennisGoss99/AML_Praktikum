    "\n",
    "Partial dependence plots (PDP) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots can be used to visualize and analyze the interaction between the target response and a set of input features of interest.\n",
    "Both PDPs [H2009] and ICEs [G2015] assume that the input features of interest are independent from the complement features and this assumption is often violated in practice. Thus, in the case of correlated features, we will create absurd data points to compute the PDP/ICE.\n",

    "**YOUR TASKS in this exercise are as follows**:\n",
    "1. import the notebook to Google Colab or use your local machine.\n",
    "2. make sure you specified you name and your matriculation number in the header below my name and date. \n",
    "    * set the date too and remove mine.\n",
    "3. read the entire notebook carefully \n",
    "    * add comments whereever you feel it necessary for better understanding\n",
    "    * run the notebook for the first time.\n",
    "    * try to follow the interpretations by printing out the decision tree and look for the feature patterns that the PDPs indicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PART I**<br>\n",
    "4. download an interesting data set from Kaggle and do the preprocessing.<br>\n",
    "5. change the classifier according to the data set. The more blackbox the better.<br>\n",
    "6. use PDP to identify the most relevant features explaining the target response of the data set.<br> \n",
    "7. comment your entire code and your findings.<br>  \n",
